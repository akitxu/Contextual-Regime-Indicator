# Contextual Regime Indicator (CRI) — V7‑3
A quantitative, cross‑asset risk indicator for modern financial markets.

## Overview

The **Contextual Regime Indicator (CRI)** is a quantitative indicator designed to evaluate the current health of a financial asset by combining two complementary dimensions:

- **Confidence** → stability, coherence, and directionality of recent price action

- **Risk** → volatility, noise, and sensitivity to abrupt changes

The CRI **does not** predict the future.
Its purpose is to diagnose whether an asset is currently in a:

- **Healthy regime (high CRI)**

- **Transitional or uncertain regime (medium CRI)**

- **Deteriorated or dangerous regime (low CRI)**

Think of it as a market stethoscope: it doesn’t tell you where the price will go, but it does tell you whether the asset is strong, weak, or at risk.
